      My first interaction with programming began in seventh grade with HTML as the language.
      Yes, I know HTML is not a programming language. At that time, I had no clue about what
      programming was and what a programming language is. <br>Then, later in ninth grade I learnt
      about C which got me interested in programming. Wrote a couple of programs in it.
      </p>

      <p class="lead">
      When I entered college I learnt again about C and then Java and subsequently about data structures and algorithms.
      I did various courses on computer science and also on other subjects, which I have mentioned
      in the next section. Then in the second last semester I learnt about Python. That gave me
      a deeper insight in how to write effective programs. My interest in programming sky rocketed.
      I learnt web programming so that I can see results of my hard work immediately in action. I learnt HTML, CSS and
      JavaScript. I explored frameworks like Flask, Django and Bootstrap and also learnt the popular jQuery library.
      I am currently learning more about these frameworks and also about React.

        I started my GNU/Linux jouney with Ubuntu and used it for many years. Recently, I switched to
        Arch linux on my primary machine and Ubuntu on my secondary machine. I also went ahead and tried
        tiling window managers like i3-gaps and Qtile for some time. I use Vim for all my text editing
        jobs and for writing programs (sometimes dabbling in Atom).
